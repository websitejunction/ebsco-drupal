# EBSCO Drupal Technical Exam

The project was created using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

You can see a live version [here](http://ebsco.willbermudez.com/) with the contrib Live Weather module on the left and the custom Weather Forecast on the right. 

Since I'd taken a lot of time to accomplish what I have, there were a few items I did not address yet:

1. Create permissions so that unauthenticated users see a "Please Log In" message when on the homepage.

2. A partial creation of the Content Type called Vehicle.
3. Create a drag and drop for the Weather Forecast Block in a Layout.
4. The preprocess function to alter the temperature unit.

## Weather Forecast Module

The module was initialized using the console and later configured locally. You can install the module by uploading the modules archive through Extend>Install new module.

## Additional Contrib Module (Live Weather)

I found the module [here](https://www.drupal.org/project/live_weather). 

## A Special Thank You

This project was extremely challenging for me and regardless of the outcome of my employment with EBSCO, it's a big win for me since I learned a great deal about Drupal, Composer and console in the process.

I appreciate the consideration and efforts put in by your team. Thanks to all of you.
